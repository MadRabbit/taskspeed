<h2>basic task test for frameworks.</h2>

<p>Every framework runs in his own iFrame, thus no conflicts can happen. Tests are run task by task, with an interval to prevent the browser from freeezing.</p>

<p>Tests are run in a neutral environment, no library or framework is included in the main javascript test, to avoid favoritism.</p>

<p>Tests are run against a local copy of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">this document</a>. They add, remove, append, connect and otherwise mangle the DOM as defined by the <a href="tests/sample-tests.js">sample-tests.js</a> file
